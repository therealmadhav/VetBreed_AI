VetBreed AI — Dog Breed Identifier
VetBreed AI is a dog breed identification application designed for veterinary clinics and pet-care workflows. It predicts a dog’s breed from an uploaded image and returns the top predictions with confidence scores to support faster profiling during intake, record creation, and customer support.

This project is built as a practical end-to-end AI application, combining a trained image classification model with a simple interface and an optional API layer for integration.
